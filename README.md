# HaveYouEverBeenBlind

## Idea
Game that simulates the world seen by a blind person. It shows how difficult it is for blind people to live in our society, even in their own homes. Players can "see" from a first person perspective and try to accomplish simple tasks.

In the beginning we wanted to do much more but unfortunately we didn't manage to do so. Thus for now players can try to accomplish very easy tasks such as finding a specific item by using our revolutionary concept of "touching" objects.

## Running the game
Just download precompiled build from the repository. It should work fine. Steering is very straightforward:
* W - go straightforward
* S - go back
* A - go left
* D - go right
* space - jump
* mouse - look around
* LMB - "touch"
